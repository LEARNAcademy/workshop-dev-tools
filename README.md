## Purpose
Get exposure to a few tools commonly used by web developers

## Browser developer tools (30 mins)
  * Why do developers use (Chrome) browser tools  -- change meetup to require Chrome (not VSCode)
      During process of development, it is usually quicker to use Chrome Dev Tools 
      for experimentation, debugging, and testing. Debugging - defects and "bugs" are terms
      used interchangably to describe something isn't working or behaving the way is it expected to.
      By "debugging", a developer is doing the investigative work to figure out 
      what (and where) the problem is while the program is running.

  * Short review: HTML CSS JS
      There are three languages often used in building a webpage: 
      - HTML: HyperText Markup Language - For the structure and raw content of the page 
        There are two input fields and a button with "Add" displayed on it.
      - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets - Presentation of content
        The button is green with rounded edges and becomes a lighter shade of green when the cursor hovers the button.
      - JS: Javascript - Interactivity of content
        When that button is clicked, it adds two numbers and displays the sum.
